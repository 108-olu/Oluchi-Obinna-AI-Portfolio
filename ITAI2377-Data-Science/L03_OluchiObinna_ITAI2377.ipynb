Most of the remaining fields are categorical, including demographic information like gender, service-related details such as PhoneService, InternetService, StreamingTV, and TechSupport, as well as customer contract details like Contract, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod, and the target column Churn.

The TotalCharges column sometimes contains blank entries, usually for customers with very short tenures, which causes the column to be read as text instead of strictly numerical. The SeniorCitizen column is stored as 0 and 1, which makes it numerical by format except its categorical in meaning, as it simply represents a \"Yes\" or \"No\" condition. Also, several service-related columns, like MultipleLines or OnlineSecurity, include values such as \"No phone service\" or \"No internet service.\" While not missing values, these function as special categories that may need to be recoded depending on the analysis. Lastly, customerID should remain unique for each entry, and duplicate IDs would be considered unusual if they appear in the dataset."
